-- add <script> tag in the body section of the html. not the head.
-- <noscript> is a tag that will display a particular message if the javascript is turned off using a extension
-- generally js is included into another file and import it to html.
-- usage of "differ" in the tag.
-- var keyword is used to define a variable. 
-- float and integers are of type numbers.
-- anything with a text is a string. 
-- array is an object 
-- [1,2,3,'4'] || [1, 2 , 3, variable]. index of an array starts with "0".
-- undefined keyword, Null, NaN
-- null==undefined /*the output is true*/
   null === undefined /*the output is false*//*strict equals, checks type equality*/
   typeof NaN is a number. 
   typeof null is an object.
   typeof undefined is undefined.

-- objects. can have fields and methods. 
  var aman{
  name:'aman'
  };
  
  consolelog(aman.name);
  
-- global and local scopes
-- strict mode: used for proper syntax only. "use strict". semi colons are a better practice to be added
-- js supports dynamic typing. we can assign same variable to number as well as strings. we can switch things.
-- js offers hoisting!! means it goes through the code twice. This gets all the variable declarations to the top line. 

               aman = 1;
               console.log(aman);
               var aman; 

               this is equal to 

               var aman; 
               aman = 1;
               console.log(aman);

               but 
               console.log(aman);
               var aman; 
               aman = 1;
               will produce an output that is "undefined". because the declaration must be done before hand. 
               otherwise it is using some variable without 
               any declaration
               
-- function aman(){} is the syntax of the function. and it is called using the function keyword aman(); . Thanks to hoisting we can call
the fucntion and declare it, or vice versa. 

      another way to declare a function is 

      var aman=function (){};// typeof aman is "function"

      we can also equate functions like we have taken equate number variable:

      var ali=aman;//ali() is same as aman()
-- function parameters are same as other languages. aman(a);

-- flow control can be done using if, else if, else. // '1' or any number that is greater
is interpreted as true in boolean thing

-- 1==true//true
   1===true//false
   2==true//false
   if(2)// its greater than zero are true.
